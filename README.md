# FitnessApp
Fitness Application made for fun using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
## More Info
This project will follow important RESTful API principles. I'll be working on progressively adding more functions. My main focus here is making the site scalable, clean, and high-quality. Designs and UIs are to be minimalistic, yet attractive.
## Current Progress
* Sign in / registration working
* Persistence of sign in status upon refresh working
* Posting to a user's library of exercises pulled from the open API.
## Sources
* Most methods for this project were learned in SE/COMS 319 at Iowa State University.
* SVGs used are free [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
* I also used an open public API. Here is the link for it: [wger Workout Manager](https://wger.de/en/software/api).
