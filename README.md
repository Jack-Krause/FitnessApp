# FitnessApp
Fitness Application made for fun using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
## More Info
This project will follow important RESTful API principles. I'll be working on progressively adding more functionalities. My main focus here is making the site scalable, clean, and high-quality. Designs and UIs are to be minimalistic, yet attractive.
## Sources
Most methods for this project were learned in SE/COMS 319 at Iowa State University.
